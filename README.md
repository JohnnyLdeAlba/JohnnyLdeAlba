## Hi, I'm Johnny de Alba!

I am a freelance developer from Vallejo, California with experience in a variety of programming disiplines. I'm a Full Stack developer, a UX/UI designer, web3 developer, a game designer, a Database devleoper, and I can reverse engineer software from a variety of different platforms. 

There is nothing I can't do! I love development and I love learning!

## Languages and Libraries I Know

- Programming Languages: C, C++, C#, Pascal, Java, ActionScript, JavaScript, TypeScript, Perl, PHP, Python
- Databases: MySQL/MariaDB, PostGres
- Libraries: ReactJS, Win32 API, Ethers.js, Express.js, OpenGL, WebGL, Direct2D, DirectX 8
- Assembly Languages: 6502, 68000, x86, z80
- Other: HTML5, CSS3

## Favorite Projects I've Built

Below are a sample of projects that I've built from scratch. Until I got into development professionally I preferred creating everything from the ground up.

- [A Wiki (2008)](https://enigma4.nexusultima.com/cgi-bin)
- [A Social Network (2012)](https://enigmav.nexusultima.com)
- [A Game Demo](https://nexusultima.com/agartha.html5)
- [A Game Engine](https://nexusultima.com/bluedream.js)
- [A Graphics Extraction Library (for the Ecco the Dolphin series)](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/ecco-lib)
- [Password Encoders and Decoders (for the Ecco the Dolphin series)](https://eccothedolphin.online/ecco2-password-generator)

## React and web3!

- [MyIPC.io](https://myipc.io/) A React based dApp that decodes game characters from the Ethereum blockchain.
- [Ecco the Dolphin Online](https://eccothedolphin.online/) A website built in React and Typescript that has an image gallery and articles.

## My Greatest Programming Achievement

My greatest programming achievement was disassembling code from the Ecco the Dolphin series and porting it to C. My goal was to extract the graphics from these wonderful games which required:

- Learning 68000 assembly.
- Learning how to use tools for reverse engineering software (such as [Radare2](https://rada.re/n)).
- Learning about the Sega Genesis's hardware including color, sprite and tile formats.
- Finding the decompression algorithms used for tiles and levels and porting them to C. 
- Figuring out the formats for sprites, level chunks and level maps and exporting them to an image.
